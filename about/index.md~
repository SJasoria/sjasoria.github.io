Hailing from Jaipur, I'm currently pursuing Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology and Science.

I have been into development for quite some time now, mostly working with JavaScript and Python. Machine Learning has caught my interest recently.

I am an avid reader, I follow cricket and I love trying new cuisines (being a vegetarian puts a lot of restrictions here).
