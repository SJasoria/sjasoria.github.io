Hailing from Jaipur, I’m currently pursuing Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani.
 
I have been into development for quite some time now, mostly working with JavaScript and Python. Most of it was done while contributing to [Perfherder](https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Perfherder), Mozilla’s dashboard to analyse performance test results. I have written python scripts to automate small tasks. Machine Learning has recently caught my interest.

A few of all the things I like:

+ Reading, anything from a blog to a novel.
+ Cricket, would leave everything to watch India’s match.
+ Trying out different cuisines, being a vegetarian poses a downside.
+ Music, minus the EDM.
+ Wonder Woman <3
+ And yes, coding.
