Hello, all!

Finally after spending days in deciding a theme, I have managed to start a blog. 
 
In this blog, I will mostly talk about projects Iâ€™m working on, but occasionally about other things too. The motivation for starting a blog lies in getting shortlisted for Google Summer of Code '17.
 
My GSoC project is with Mozilla wherein I have to design an easy-to-use web interface to visualise test results and check for regression in the performance of various Mozilla products. More on this in the next post.
 
Until then. :)
